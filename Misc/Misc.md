**Miscellaneous**

Useful notebooks that don't necessarily fit into any other section , or files and folders that are necessary for the running of this code.

**CIFs Folder**

This folder contains CIF files for every element on the Periodic Table I could find, in the most stable and pure condition they could be recorded. This is necessary for the running of the Ceria Analysis and Cubic Peak Fit - an integral part of both the 3D Data and Grain Size Analysis. Save these in a folder on your computer and record the path for later use.

**Grouping Files**

This folder contains xml files indicating the pattern the banks should be seperated by for the Grain Size Analysis. Like with the CIF files, save these in a folder and record the path for later use.

**Summary txt**

This is a txt file containing all ENGIN-X experiments as of 25/6/25. This is necessary for a function common between most of the notebooks found here, so again, save these in a folder and record the path for later use.

**FileSearch**

This is the file searching function in a notebook of its own. Provide the run, bank, and experiment, then the function should return its location, the summed spectra where the data can be extracted from, and the parameter for the requested experiment. The raw file can also be saved to or extracted from your computer on request.

**Manual Peak Fits**

This allows you to fit peaks to a run's data either with known elements or by selecting them on a graph.

This is especially useful if you would like a more reliable fit on non-cubic materials.
